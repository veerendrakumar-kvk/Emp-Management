Warning: Running a server with --disable-host-check is a security risk. See https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a for more information.
The "disableHostCheck" option will not be used because it is not supported by the "@angular-devkit/build-angular:application" builder.
